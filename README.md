# Library Coding Assignment

This programming assignment gives a variety of functions to run without built in functions being used.

## Constants

ASCII_LOWERCASE = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`  
  This is anstring of all lowercase English alphabet characters.
  
ASCII_UPPERCASE = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"`  
  This is a string of all uppercase English alphabet characters.
  
 DECIMAL_DIGITS = "0123456789"`  
  This is a string of all decimal digits from 0 to 9.

  ### Functions
  **is_alpha**: Loops through each character in the word. Checks if a string contains only alphabetic characters. Will report True if all characters are alphabetical. If else it will report False.
  
  **is_digit**: Loops through each character in the word. Checks if a string contains only numeric characters. Will report True if all characters are numeric. If else it will report False.

  **to_lower(s)**: Convertes the uppercase characters that are located in the string to lowercase characters. If the character is not uppercase it will remain the same.

  **to_upper(s)**: Converts all lowercase characters that are located in the string to upperscase characters. If the character is not lowercase it will remain the same.

  **find_chr(s,char)**: Checks if a single character in the string can be found. If not found it will return -1 and if it is not a single character it will return -1 as well.

  #### Example Output:

  The example I used was is_digit("abc") to show you that the output came back False becasue it does not follow under the numeric terms for the function.
